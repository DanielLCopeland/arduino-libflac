# arduino-libflac

FLAC is an Open Source lossless audio codec developed by Josh Coalson from 2001
to 2009. From 2012 to 2021 it was maintained by Erik de Castro Lopo. It continues
to be maintained by various volunteers under the auspices of the Xiph.org Foundation.

## Installation in Arduino

You can download the library as zip and execute -> Sketch -> Include Library -> Add .ZIP library. 
Or you can git clone this project into the Arduino libraries folder with

```
cd  ~/Documents/Arduino/libraries
git clone https://github.com/pschatzmann/arduino-libflac.git

```
## Documentation

I recommend to use this library together with my [Arduino Audio Tools](https://github.com/pschatzmann/arduino-audio-tools). 
This is just one of many __codecs__ that I have collected so far: Further details can be found in the [Encoding and Decoding Wiki](https://github.com/pschatzmann/arduino-audio-tools/wiki/Encoding-and-Decoding-of-Audio) of the Audio Tools.

## Dependencies

This library requires [arduino-libopus](https://github.com/pschatzmann/arduino-libopus)
